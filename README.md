# 3d-maze-explorer
A simple 3d maze exploration game made for a hackathon.

For this I limited myself to using only basic java libraries.

Controls:
W: Move forward
A: Move left
S: Move backward
D: Move right
Mouse: Look around
L: Enable mouse lock for free look
U: Enable mouse unlock for free look
F11: Emergency exit key
